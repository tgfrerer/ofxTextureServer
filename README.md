# ofxTextureServer

A garbage-collected container and (pre)loader of ofTextures.

## Motivation

ofTextureServer helps you to memory-manage ofTextures. It will keep your footprint low if you plan to work with lots of ofTextures. Use ofTextureServer to keep track of all your ofTextures, to preload whole directories of images into ofTextures, so that you you can access them instantly once your app is running, or to help you automate your texture memory management.

## Example

See included example project.
