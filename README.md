# ofxTextureServer

A garbage-collected container and (pre)loader of ofTextures.

## Motivation

ofxTextureServer helps you to keep track of ofTextures. It will keep your
footprint low if you plan to work with lots of ofTextures.

ofxTextureServer uses a map internally and keeps track of the use count of
its textures.

Useful to keep track of all your ofTextures, to preload whole directories of
images into ofTextures and access them instantly once your app is running, or
to help you automate texture memory management.

I use ofxTextureServer in a couple of projects that require a scene graph{, or
that use one central place where to get all textures from}. [The Pirate Cannon][nmm-pc] 
and [Project Runway](http://poniesandlight.co.uk/projects/project_runway/) were such projects.

For example, most pirate ships in [The Pirate Cannon][nmm-pc] use the same
spritesheet to animate the sails. Each pirate ship object holds a reference to
the scene graph's global ofxTextureServer. Therefore all ships can share the
same texture and it is loaded from its original image file only once during
preload.

## Example
